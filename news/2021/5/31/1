here's an unordered list:
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

here's an ordered list:
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

another cool thing are task lists:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
