# Section One
*Some bold text*
_Some italic text_
~~this is strikethrough text~~
> Some quoted text, and 
> a continuation of the quote.

## Subsection 1.1
here's an unordered list:
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

here's an ordered list:
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

### Sub-Subsection 1.1.1
another cool thing are task lists:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

# Section Two
[this is a link](https://munsy.io)

```go
func myCodeBlock() string {
	return "this is a code block example"
}
```

here's the start of a sentence, and `this is inline code` and some normal text after it
